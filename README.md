#### Build an Image:

`docker build -t <your_dockerhub_directory>/image_name:tag`

Ensure that you have Docker installed and properly set up before running the docker build commands. Once built, you can deploy this serverless worker in your desired environment with confidence that it will automatically scale based on demand.
